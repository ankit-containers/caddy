Caddy is a web server written in Go. It supports automatic HTTPS. This image
provides Caddy inside Distroless base-image.

```bash
docker pull quay.io/ankitrgadiya/caddy
```

## Releases

Caddy upstream project follows semantic versioning. So, the image tags will
correspond to the upstream release versions. The `latest` tag will always point
to the most recent release. I intend to provide all versions from "2.3.0"
onwards.
